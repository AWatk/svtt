kmolnar - barrier is finding places to distribute


CARES funds through December(?) opening food banks and hot meal distributions
vans with rotating schedules

How do you deal with more demand than supply?
  - occured much more frequently at the height of covid

accessibility:
  transportation used to not be an option, now can work with amazon and lyft
     - lyft code if they have a phone and credit card
     - lyft conceirge if not (normally a one-off thing)




* Metropolitan Action Commission

Lisa McCrady

rent, mortgage assistance in addition to food aid

not specifically a food distribution org

was able to open locations near bus routes after the tornados in order
to supply food (federal funding)

federal funding for summer food program

emphasized to feel free to probe and find gaps in coverage


* MNPS
Alison McArthur
alison.mcarthur@mnps.org

a real barrier is the amount of volunteers (partially due to covid)

working to add more partners
